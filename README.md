# NY-State-Hospital-Length-of-Stay-Cost-Forecasting


Worked with a hospital inpatient discharges dataset from the New York State Department of Health (1.6M rows) to predict hospitalization costs based on patient-specific characteristics and length of stay. Developed a preprocessing pipeline in Python using libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-Learn to clean and transform the data, incorporating recursive feature selection to refine inputs before model training. Fine-tuned machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, XGBoost, and linear regression, through Bayesian optimization, grid search, and random search, ultimately determining that XGBoost achieved the best performance with the lowest RMSE.
